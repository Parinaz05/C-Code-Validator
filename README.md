# C-Code-Validator
A simple yet functional C++ program that checks user-entered code for common syntax errors like missing semicolons, unmatched braces, or missing #include and main() statements. The validator uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, exception handling, and dynamic memory allocation to ensure clean and error-free code input.
