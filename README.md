## Overview

The C++ Code Validator is a console-based tool that checks user-inputted C++ programs for basic syntax errors.
It ensures that essential syntax elements like #include statements, main() function, semicolons, and braces are properly used before accepting the code as valid.
The project emphasizes OOP principles, error handling, and interactive user feedback.

## Project Objective

- To design a simple C++ program that validates code syntax dynamically.
- To implement inheritance and polymorphism through validator classes.
- To demonstrate practical use of exception handling for error detection.
- To create an interactive console tool that promotes learning through correction.

## Technology Stack

Language: C++

## Core Concepts:

Classes and Objects

- Inheritance & Polymorphism
- Exception Handling
- Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Control Structures & Loops
- STL (Strings & Vectors)

## Program Flow

- User enters C++ code line by line.
- Code is stored dynamically using vector<string>.
- Validator checks for missing semicolons, unmatched braces, and essential keywords
- If any error is found, an exception is thrown and displayed.
- The program loops until valid syntax is detected.
- Once validated, the program confirms success and exits.

## Future Enhancements

- Expand to detect more syntax errors and logical issues.
- Add GUI support for user-friendly interaction.
- Highlight specific error lines in color-coded format.
- Integrate file-based input for larger code validation.

## Key Learnings

- Application of OOP principles (abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism).
- Use of exception handling to control error flow.
- Importance of input validation and user feedback in programming tools.
- Understanding of dynamic memory management and STL usage.
