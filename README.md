# C-Code-Validator

A simple yet functional C++ program that checks user-entered code for common syntax errors like missing semicolons, unmatched braces, or missing #include and main() statements. The validator uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, exception handling, and dynamic memory allocation to ensure clean and error-free code input.

## Features

Checks for essential C++ syntax elements (#include, main(), braces, semicolons).

Provides detailed error messages and prompts user until code is correct.

Demonstrates OOP concepts – classes, inheritance, polymorphism.

Uses exception handling to detect and report syntax issues.

Dynamic memory allocation for user input handling.

Clean and modular structure for easy understanding and future expansion.

## Tech Stack

Language: C++

Concepts Used: Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Exception Handling, Dynamic Memory

## How It Works

Run the program.

Paste your C++ code (end input with END).

The validator checks for syntax issues.

If errors exist, you get feedback and can try again.

Program ends only when valid code is entered.

## Learning Outcomes

Understand how compilers validate syntax at a basic level.

Strengthen knowledge of OOP design and exception handling in C++.

Improve debugging and code correctness skills.

## Future Enhancements

Add advanced syntax checks (nested structures, data types, etc.).

Introduce GUI for interactive validation using Qt or Tkinter (via Python bridge).

Implement color-coded output and code suggestions.
